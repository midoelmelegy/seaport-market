The Reservoir API is an all-in-one endpoint for building applications around NFT Liquidity. This includes everything from price exploration tools to full-featured marketplaces. It gives access to:

- Aggregated liquidity from popular NFT marketplaces
- Granular price data with flexible querying options
- Raw order objects, for executing buys and sells
- Detailed metadata that can be used to analyze data (e.g. trait floors)
- Advanced order types, like collection and trait-wide bids

Best of all, it's powered by Reservoir's Open Order Book, meaning that you aren't dependent on the whims of a centralized gatekeeper. You can either use a hosted version for speed and convenience, or run it yourself with all the same features and no limits.
