# Introduction

The NFT market exploded in 2021, yet it still remains relatively immature and illiquid. Most secondary trading happens on a single marketplace, orders are stored in centralized databases and the market making industry consists of a few bots making low-ball offers.

This is largely because NFT marketplaces follow a monolithic model, tightly coupling their front-ends, order books and swap contracts, which fragments liquidity and creates bottlenecks for innovation.

Reservoir unbundles this model with an open and permissionless order book that aggregates all liquidity into a single shared pool.

Reservoirâ€™s modular architecture is a new primitive that unlocks powerful possibilities:

1. An abundance of marketplaces can emerge, all trying different approaches or focusing on different communities, without fragmenting liquidity.

2. Tools can specialize on one segment of the market, like wallets offering built-in sell functionality, or a rarity explorer that is focused on the buying experience.

3. Novel new forms of liquidity (AMMs, collection-wide offers, etc) can quickly find adoption by feeding into all of the marketplaces and interfaces leveraging the shared order book.

4. Anyone can provide liquidity, without worrying about API keys or rate limits, making it more accessible to both professional market makers and regular collectors.

Reservoir is not another marketplace. It's a new layer in the stack, designed to complement the layers above and below. WAGMI.

By fully embracing the web3 principles of open data and composability, Reservoir aims to unleash a wave of innovation at all layers of the stack, bringing vastly improved liquidity to NFTs.
