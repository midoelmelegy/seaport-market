# Community Marketplace

Reservoir's API and SDK makes it incredibly simple to build a community marketplace that go deep on a particular NFT project. Communities can tailor the UX (and the fees), all while accessing an aggregated order book with all available listings.

In fact, the first product that was used to test the Reservoir Protocol was [Loot.Exchange](https://loot.exchange), a marketplace for all things Loot. We envisage a future where every NFT project has their own secondary marketplace, built by the community, for the community. Reservoir makes this possible.

Rather than explain it, we have built a fully-functional [Sample Marketplace](https://github.com/reservoirprotocol/sample-marketplace) that can be easily adapted to any community. It's the quickest way to get started building with Reservoir.
