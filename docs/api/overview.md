# Reservoir API

The Reservoir API is an all-in-one endpoint for building NFT applications. This includes everything from market exploration tools to full-featured marketplaces. It gives access to:

- Aggregated liquidity from popular NFT marketplaces
- Granular price data with flexible querying options
- Raw order objects, for executing buys and sells
- Detailed metadata that can be used to analyze data (e.g. trait floors)
- Advanced order types, like collection and trait-wide bids

Best of all, the API is powered by an open-source Indexer that runs entirely off open and permissionless data sources. This means there are no centralized gatekeepers to depend on. You can use a hosted version of the API to quickly get up and running, or run your own if you need more control.

## Next Steps

1. Get started with the [Hosted API](hosted-api)
2. Explore some of the popular [Use Cases](use-cases/get-token-prices)
3. Fork the [Sample Marketplace](https://github.com/reservoirprotocol/sample-marketplace)
